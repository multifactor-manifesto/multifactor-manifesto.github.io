        Use YubiKeys or comparible hardware whenever possible. Prefer websites that offer U2F or FIDO2 (WebAuthn),
        as this offers the best protection against phishing and data breaches. Hardware keys with biometrics or PINs
        are even better, so long as they support U2F or FIDO2.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-large w3-center">
        To avoid being locked out of your accounts, register multiple hardware keys. Keep them in different places,
        such as one in your pocket, and one at home, at your office, car, in a safety deposit box, or at a trusted
        friend or relative's house (maybe even hide it there so they don't know about it). You don't want all your
        hardware keys at home, in case of something like a fire or robbery. Label your keys so you can easily revoke any
        that's lost or compromised.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-large w3-center">
        If you're still worried about being locked out of an account, you may want to save some backup codes someplace
        safe. Just don't put them on your phone or on your computer where they could be found by anyone with access to
        your device. The reason is that account recovery (forgotten password) often only requires access to email and
        one form of multifactor authentication (MFA). Hence, if you're already logged into your email on your phone or
        computer, and someone gains access and can also find your backup codes, then they may be able to takeover your
        accounts.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-large w3-center">
        If a provider does not provide support for U2F or FIDO2 hardware keys, then share <a href="/">this site</a>
        with them. If you still must use their service, then opt for push notifications. If they don't support that, then
        opt for an authenticator app (also known as Time-based One Time Passwords, or TOTP).
    </p>
    <p class="w3-large w3-center">
        Although better than nothing, avoid SMS-based MFA if there are other options. It's susceptible
        to social engineering, in addition to phishing and data breaches. If there's no other choice, try to use a
        carrier that provides some protections against this, such as setting a PIN on your account, or <a
        href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/how-to-protect-your-verizon-number-from-sim-swapping-attacks/">
        locking your phone number</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-large w3-center">
        If your provider offers strong MFA (like U2F keys) but forces you to have a weaker backup (like SMS),
        then still use the strongest form possible as your primary means. If you normally use U2F, then you'll be safe
        from phishing, and if your "provider" ever asks you to use a different form of MFA, then you'll at least be
        highly suspicious and on your guard.
