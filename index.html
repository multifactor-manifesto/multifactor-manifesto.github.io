        For consumers: If you value your financial and cyber security, share this with your banks, email provider,
        and any other internet service you use.

    <p class="w3-large w3-center">
        <img src="business-24px.svg" class="invert" />
        For banks, email providers, and providers of other important internet services: If you value your customers'
        security, you should follow these guidelines.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-large w3-center">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Allow customers to register U2F or FIDO2 (WebAuthn) keys, such as Yubikeys. These provide protection
                against phishing, which authentication codes do not.
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow customers to register <em>multiple</em> U2F or FIDO2 keys. In order to prevent lockout if a
                single key is lost or damaged, your service must support multiple keys.
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow customers to download backup codes, which are at least 16 characters long each and consist of
                uppercase, lowercase and numeric characters. These can further prevent lockout if all security keys are
                lost or damaged. Your company should treat these as passwords, and only store secure hashes of them so
                that if your database of them is breached, hackers cannot use them. Furthermore, each code should be one
                use only, to prevent replay attacks.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="w3-large w3-center">
        You <em>may</em> provide the following forms of multifactor authentication, but must allow customers to reject
        them. That is, you must not require them as a fallback or backup. While these are all better than no multifactor
        authentication, they are all susceptible to phishing attacks.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-large w3-center">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Push notifications to phones. Even when they say from which city or IP the request is made, hackers
                can easily do man-in-the-middle attacks in the same city as the customer, and most customers don't
                know their IP.
            </li>
            <li>
                Authenticator codes / apps (also known as Time-based One Time Passwords, or TOTP). Besides
                being susceptible to man-in-the-middle phishing attacks, these are also susceptible to data breaches.
                The secret from which time-based codes are generated must be known to the service in order to validate
                codes. Hence a breach may expose it and hackers could generate their own codes from it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Text messages (SMS) or phone calls. These are especially bad. Besides being susceptible to all of the
                above attacks, they're also susceptible to
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam">SIM swapping</a>. SIM swapping is one of the
                easiest and most common attacks for hackers to implement.
            </li>
        </ul>

        You must not use "security questions" based on public information.

                Answers to questions such as, "What street did you grow up on?", or, "Where did you go to high school?",
                are easily found on many people's public Facebook profiles or other public information. These questions offer
                very little protection against targeted identity theft and give people a false sense of security.

        Password resetting is often the weakest link of security.

        <ul>
            <li>
                If a customer forgets their password, and has multifactor authentication enabled, then you must require
                multifactor authentication before sending a reset link to their email.
